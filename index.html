                            This was my senior thesis project that I worked with my
                            partner Daniel Echeverri. Our thesis “Design of a Closed

                            Deformable Mirror Technologies” was advised by Professor
                            N. Jeremy Kasdin and Professor Robert Stengel.
                            Our thesis received top marks and was nominated for
                            several departmental awards.

                            This was my final team project and final report for my
                            MAE 412 Microprocessors course. My two partners were
                            Joshua Umansky and Daniel Echeverri. In the first half
                            of the course, my team designed, built and programmed
                            a single-board microcomputer. For the second half of
                            the course, we programmed the microcomputer to
                            synchronize two model trains on different levels of a
                            railroad set. The project used three hall effect
                            sensors on each railway to find data points to predict
                            the speed and location of both trains. Hornby

                            This project was my final team project and report for my
                            MAE 321 Engineering Design course. The purpose of the
                            project was to build a small submarine with a $1000
                            budget to meet certain specs and go through an
                            obstacle course. I was on the propulsion team focusing
                            on the motors, electronics, and controls of the
                            submarine.

                        <p class = "project_paragraph">
                            When I began working for Princeton's High Contrast
                            Imaging Lab as an undergraduate researcher, I was given
                            a ferrofluid deformable mirror prototype. The prototype
                            wasn't sending the proper signals and I was given the
                            task of finding the issue by rebuilding a model from
                            discrete components. I began by studying the
                            fundamentals of logic design and understanding how to
                            fix inductive spikes. From there, I quickly advanced to
                            building small circuits and eventually intoduced the
                            Digital to Analog Converters (DAC) to set up the control
                            for seven inductors. I then learned LabVIEW and I2C
                            protocol to control the indutors from a computer
                            through a myRIO device.
